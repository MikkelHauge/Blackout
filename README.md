# BlackoutWin

Why?

I have multiple monitors.

I play videogames on the center-monitor. the others show a wallpaper, usually. That can be quite distracting to watch some fancy colorful wallpaper, when you're trying to enjoy a game. So this program basically detects when something is in fullscreen. Then it sets the wallpaper to be a black solid color.

When it then detects you're not in fullscreen anymore, it sets the wallpaper to a random one, from a very specific folder (custom folder is on the todolist!) - it currently only cares about F:\Pictures\Wallpapers (I was lazy)

This is still a work in progress.

Todo:

set a folder path for the wallpapers

possibly set wallpaper "fit" (stretch, span etc)

some tweaks and polish.

a "timer" of sorts, so it doesn't go back to showing a wallpaper, straight after having turned the wallpapers black (sometimes you tap in/out of a game, or watch super short videos on youtube)

Made just for fun.
