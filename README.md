# Blackout

What does it do?

Sets the wallpapers to be solid black, when fullscreen (of any kind) is detected.

When fullscreen is not detected anymore, it sets a random wallpaper, from a folder, chosen by the user.

Why?

I have multiple monitors.

I play videogames on the center-monitor. the others show a wallpaper, usually. That can be quite distracting to watch some fancy colorful wallpaper, when you're trying to enjoy a game.

When it then detects you're not in fullscreen anymore, it sets the wallpaper to a random one, from a chosen folder. 

Also note: When closing the program, it just minimizes to system tray. 
You have to right click and close it from there.

This is still a work in progress.

Todo:

possibly set wallpaper "fit" (stretch, span etc)

some tweaks and polish.

a "timer" of sorts, so it doesn't go back to showing a wallpaper, straight after having turned the wallpapers black (sometimes you tap in/out of a game, or watch super short videos on youtube)

Made just for fun.
